# Abstract:  
Apply minimum spanning tree, the paper presents an approach using centralities to identify influencial/vital user in a network. This would allow a more indepth study of the account to determine their legitimacy and influence. Since

# Introduction:  
Dealing with undesirable user - such as trolls - can be hard. However, they all share the same characteristic in their network: their importance. This can be seen via calculating their respective centralities. 
# Problem:  
How to track and find the influencial users and from where does an information or rumor started? 
# Theoretical Method:  
Centrality of each user in the constructed graph of relation.  
In this case, the centrality used will be degree centrality: the higher the degree will result in the connectivity of the user. In a directed graph, this will also shown if this is an influencer (a user with a majority of outward degree) or a receiver (a user with a majority of inward degree)
# Solution:  
One would need to perform calculation of all centrality on all points. The centrality would be used to rank the important level of each user.  
# Application:  

# Drawbacks:  

# Conclusion:
